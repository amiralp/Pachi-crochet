## Face

_Warning_: I realized this pattern was too small once attached to the body, so I had to do extra rounds around it when already attached.

You basically build an oval along the initial chain, so when you reach one of the "edges" continue the row on the other side of the stitch.

R1: ch x10 (10)  
R2: starting at 2nd ch, 1 sc in each of the following 8 ch, then go to the other side of the last ch and 3 sc in it (11)  
R3-4: 1 sc in next 8 sc, 2 sc in each next 2 sc (12)  
R5: 1 sc in next 8 sc, 2 sc in next sc, 1 sc in next sc, 2 sc in next sc (13)  
R6: 1 sc in next 9 sc, 2 sc in next sc, 1 sc in next sc, 2 sc in next sc (14)  
R7: 1 sc in next 9 sc, 2 sc in next sc, 1 sc in next 2 sc, 2 sc in next sc (15)  
R8: 1 sc in next 2 sc, 2 sc in sc, 1 sc in each next 2 sc, 2 sc in sc, 1 sc in next 9 sc (17)  
R9: 1 sc in next 10 sc, 2 sc in sc, 1 sc in each next 2 sc, 2 sc in sc, 1 sc in next 3 sc (19)  

_Freestyle: Here is where I added stitches because the pattern was too small: add sc stitches until you've done 2 extra ovals around the piece._

R10: 1 sc in next 2 sc, 1 sl st in next 5 sc, 1 sc in 4 sc, 2 sc in sc, 1 sc in next 7 sc, close with sl (20)  
Finish: Tie the end, cut the extra yarn, cut and glue/sew the cheeks and mouth.

## Body

![Pachimari body done](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amiralp/Pachi-crochet/main/photos/004.jpg)

R1: mr6 (6)  
R2: (sc, inc) x3 (9)

_If using buttons, sew them on the face. If using safety eyes, position the face on the body and fasten the safety eyes through both layers (face + body). Stitch the face to the body using the yarn needle and white yarn:_

Finish: sc, sc, sl st, tie & close.

Stitch legs together using yarn needle and green yarn before attaching them to the body. An alternative solution would be to crochet a small green circle, attach the legs to it, and then stitch it to the body if you prefer.

You can also crochet a small circle and hide the center space.
